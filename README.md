# SemesterProject
When you run the code, you will be asked several questions. 

The first will be to enter the sale amount, then the tip amount, followed by the total.

The tip and total give you an option to enter -1 if either one is unknown.

At the end you will be asked would you like to continue and you would enter Y or N. 

If you click Y the code will ask you the same questions again and in the end it will add up all the tips for each person.

If you enter N, the code will stop and give you the tips for each person based on what you entered.
